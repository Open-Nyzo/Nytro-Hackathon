# [$3000-$10000 NYZO] Nytro Hackathon: Implementation of an application that uses the Nytro token protocol

This is the repository that will be used to gather Idenary submission to Nyzo hackathon.

## About Idenary

Idenary is an informal team of artists and coders who assembled to bring fresh air and colors to crypto.  
We made a first contribution in a previous hackathon, that did not get the traction we hoped it would. Maybe this time is the right one!

## Our entry

**Website is available at https://Pixo.gallery/**

First idea was to adapt our current Idenary.com website to enable Nyzo in addition of Idena.  
However since Nyzo does not support a login scheme yet, this seemed a poor timing, with little relation ship to the hackathon.

We had another idea in mind which would need more than just tokens, but NFT with properties.  
Since NFTs on Nytro have been announced and should be available soon, we decided to try our chance with a totally new concept.

Our contribution to the Nyzo Hackathon will be a completely new service and website, Nyzo centric.  
We will however maintain our colorful touch!

We forked the repo as required to be eligible to the hackathon and will post a description of our project as soon as the Nyzo NFT details are published and we made sure we can do it in that context.

## Project name

This will be named "PIXO", and supported by "PIXO" Nyzo Token, nPIXO and nPIXO64 Nyzo NFT.

No connection to idenary.com nor Idena, this is an independent, Nyzo only project.  
Both could however be merged into a bigger project in some distant future.

## Concept

We all know those "million pixel" pages, where you can buy individual pixels to draw pics and adverts.  
This is not new, and has been ported to crypto as well with several variants.

We hope to be able to "refresh" the concept and make it more valuable - for the user as well as for Nyzo globally - by adding our twist.

The first Board we'll release as part of this hackathon will be a "small" 64x64 pixels one.  
This may seem small, but still allows for significant art and display (board will be full screen).  
This means 64x64 = 4096 individual pixels.

Every single of these pixels will be a NFT, with its owner being able to define its content (color only at start).  

Using NFT for pixels allows for a nice flexibility:  
- coordinates of every pixel is part of the NFT, immutable
- user can edit the content property (which nytro NFT allow with almost zero cost)
- Every single pixel is a trade-able item, that can gain value depending on its placement and context.
- Pixels are likely to gain value with time as their supply is limited 

The challenge is then to properly distribute the pixels to the community.  
Like with initial POS coins distribution, this is a hard thing to do in a fair way.

- If the pixel price is too low, someone could buy them all at start, be king of the board, and ruin the thing for everyone.  
- If the pixel price is too high, not everyone could afford one - let alone several ones - and it will not be used.

We will address this by:
- deliver pixels in a random way: you can not decide what precise pixel you'll buy, you'll get a random one.
- some parts of the board will have a lower chance of being delivered, we'll publish a graphical map of the pixels odds.
- do an airdrop of a significant part of the pixels. This likely will require some sort of social proof to help the concept be known and make sure pixels holders are active users. The process here is still to be defined, and likely will involve manual operations.  
  We plan to airdrop - for free - at least 33% of the pixels to active users.
- run an auction or fixed price sale on small, predefined parts of the board, for adjacent pixels. This will allow advertisers to quickly be able to communicate on the board
- The left over pixels will be available to buy, first come first serve, at a fixed initial price.

## Tech side

See [src/Readme.md](src/Readme.md) for the tech and format used.  
It was quite a stretch to get everything running in time for the hackathon, more updates will be coming in the next weeks as pixels are being released and colored!  

We apologize in advance to all devs looking at our patchwork code: We aimed for a quick and usable concept first of all, there will be place for improvements later on ;)  

## More to come

Once the pixels of this board are sold, we plan to move on with additional items and social activity to keep the ball rolling.

Among the thing we think of:
- Have sponsors pay to display a given image on the board, owners of the pixels get paid if they set the right color (your NFT gets you almost passive income)
- Marketplace, listings to facilitate NFT pixels swap or sale. Well placed pixels could become quite valuable!
- More boards with different structure and goal
- Social backed challenges
