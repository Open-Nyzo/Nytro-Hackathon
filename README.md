## Prize bounty
Up to $10000 worth of Nyzo can be earned per application for this bounty, with a minimum reward of $3000 worth of Nyzo. The correct amount will be determined by a team of judges consisting of well known Nyzo community devs and mods which will evaluate based on the following evaluation criteria:

**Minimal required criteria**:
- Functional and meaningful app
- Fully open source
- Documentation

**Additional criteria**:
- Documentation quality
- Potential for large adoption
- Ease of installation and operation
- Existing community or user base and marketing
- Originality of the concept
- Code quality
- UX and usability
- Use of the existing Nyzo ecosystem

At the end of the hackathon a winner will be chosen by a community vote, granting an extra $2000 Nyzo bonus prize. 2nd and 3rd place will receive an extra consolation prize of $1000 and $500 Nyzo. The bounty will be fully paid in the [Nyzo cryptocurrency](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nyzo).

*The jury reserves the right not to consider a submission that would not match the minimum expected requirements. In that case the jury will specify why. The submitter will be given some time to improve and submit again to be eligible for a reward.*

*The jury also reserves the right to issue extra rewards for above-the-ordinary submissions, or suggest further rewards for extra additions to the project.*


## Bounty description
[Project Nytro](https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Project-Nytro) is a token protocol that brings ERC20-like tokens to the [Nyzo blockchain](). This with a 7 seconds block time, fast finality and very low fees. The main requirement and goal of this bounty is to use the Nytro token protocol in an open-sourced project. Build an app, website, game, ... that uses the Nytro protocol and get rewarded for your effort! All the documentation about the protocol, tokens and code samples needed to build with Nytro is available on the [Nytro github](https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Project-Nytro). If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch on the [official Nyzo Discord](https://discord.gg/veYdkStw).

Sample code with a reference implementation written in Python can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Project-Nytro/tree/main/implementations/tokens).

## How to participate
In order to have a valid entry in the hackathon, following steps must be executed:
1. Clone the [Nytro Hackathon Github repository](https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Nytro-Hackathon).
2. Add a new .md file with a short abstract or project description.

The deadline for registrations is July 4th 2021. This means that after this date, no new entrants to the hackathon will be allowed.


## Submission requirements
To earn this bounty you need to submit your open-source project by executing the following steps:
1. Make sure you have a valid entry in the Nytro hackathon before July 4th 2021.
2. Make sure your project meets the minimal required criteria.
3. Create a pull request into the Nytro Hackathon Github repository before the submission deadline of August 1st 2021.
4. Join the Nyzo discord and show off your project in the [#nytro-hackathon channel](https://discord.gg/c3dxE5C6K3).

*If your project is not fully finished yet, make sure you have at least a working proof-of-concept application that meets the minimal criteria. If more work is needed to finish the project, development can always be continued after the submission deadline. Your hackathon reward will be based on the submission. A separate reward will be issued after the full implementation is delivered.*


## Reward distribution and winner announcement date
Rewards will be distributed shortly after your submission is reviewed by the judges. 

After the submission deadline, the Nyzo community will be able to vote on their favorite project in a democratic way. Voting will end on August 8th. The top 3 projects will then be announced and receive their bonus prize.


## About Nyzo
Nyzo is the first blockchain based upon the Proof-of-Diversity consensus mechanism. It's a democratic, fast, scalable and highly efficient blockchain which was founded in 2018. It was built by a team of anonymous core devs and turned into a fully community-driven project with the supporting development of the core devs. The Nyzo community maintains a fund that can be used to support work and development for Nyzo, which is controlled in a democratic way by network participants. All decisions are made on-chain by voting for Nyzo Community Fund Proposals (NCFPs). A [proposal](https://forum.nyzo.community/t/ncfp-21-nytro-hackathon/390) was made and funded to host a hackathon (which this bounty is part of) to boost the adoption of the Nytro Protocol.
