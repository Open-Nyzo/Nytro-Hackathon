# FAQ

## How to buy/sell Fairdrop Token?

Until further notice, OTC only.  
Take care of using a trusted escrow and beware of Discord impersonators!   

## Where to check my balance?

Use nyzo.today tokens explorer: https://tokens.nyzo.today/explorer/

## How to send tokens to another Nyzo wallet?

Use the proper helper: https://tokens.nyzo.today/helpers/transfer  
This will give you a "pre..." string you can then use with any nyzo wallet. Use 0.00001 as Nyzo amount to cover the - very low - fees.

## Why did I not get any FAIRDROP, (insert any complaint about nyzo wallet, exchange or queue)? 

We decided the distribution rules to reward Nyzo holders, in-cycle, and in-queue (who spend money to be there, but are not rewarded by Nyzo itself).  
If you are not in the CSV export (see Drop1 directory) then you missed out, and there is no going back in time: **distribution of Drop1 is done and final**.

There will be other opportunities to get FAIRDROP via social airdrop and grants.  
You can also buy some OTC.

## Will there be other airdrops? 

Yes. There will be more FAIRDROP dropped, and we hope to see FAIRDROP holders be rewarded with airdrops from other upcoming projects as well.

## I'm a Fairdrop User from Idena, I did not get the drop?

This drop was for Nyzo holders only. Specific actions for Idena users will follow.

## What are your plans with Fairdrop, any litepaper?

We will communicate full plans and roadmap when they are ready.   
In the mean time, we are doing our best to not disappoint you!
