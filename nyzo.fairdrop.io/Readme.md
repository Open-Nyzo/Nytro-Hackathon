# Fairdrop.Io - Nytro Hackathon submission

This will contain code and doc for our submission to the hackathon.

## About fairdrop.io

We at fairdrop believe in a long term mission: make airdrops fair.

Airdrops are a nice way to ensure initial distribution of tokens and raise awareness for newborn tokens, but they are also abused by organized and automated airdrop catchers. Our end goal is to leverage technological tool to make airdrops finally fair!

We emerged last year as one of the winners of the Idena Hackathon and plan to keep on adding more blockchains and features to our offer, until it becomes The platform of reference for fair airdrops.

## Nyzo

Nyzo describes itself as a next-gen blockchain, with fast and reliable transactions.  
Their recent "NYTRO" projects adds support for very fast and very cheap tokens transactions.

We believe Nyzo has all the needed features to become the next Hype, and surpass ETH or SOL as tokens platform.

## Our submission

We will develop and release a tool to facilitate the distribution of Nyzo tokens to specific classes of Nyzo users.  
Such a tool proved to be intrumental in the last wave of Solana airdrops for instance.

Although not a totally new idea, this tool is a pre-requisite for Nyzo to be used for aidrops, and ease up the initial distribution for new projects.

### Planned features

- Get a snapshot of Nyzo and specific Nyzo tokens balance at a given time
- Simulate distribution by specifying criterions, like specific balances of given tokens or Nyzo
- Maybe use Nyzo specific properties: differentiate in-cycle, in-queue or neither
- Provide estimates of airdrop cost, average tokens dropped (total and per wallet), and wallets count
- Once happy with the simulation, drop the tokens to the selected recipients
- Provide a csv export of the drop with transaction ids

### Operational plan

- Read doc and check Nyzo features in depth
- Test selected data sources
- First tests
- Beta release
- Official release

### Future options (not part of the hackathon)

- More fine grained criterions
- Integration as part of Fairdrop V2
